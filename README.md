# KMLtoGarminFPL

This repository contains a Python program to convert a flight plan defined as a KML file to the Garmin FPL flight plan (FPL) format. The Garmin FPL flight plan format is used in Garmin GNS 400w/500w model series used in some aircraft.

** A note about the Garmin FlightPlan Migrator Hardware and Software **

To transfer FPL files to a Garmin GNS unit via card, you need the special Garmin card reader/writer and the FlightPlan Migrator software. The card and reader seem to be proprietory. Even after installing the drivers, the card reader with the card inserted do not appear as external drives from Windows (unlike a typical USB drive, for example). The Garmin FlightPlan Migrator software lets you load FPL files on the card into one of 19 spaces.

Garmin card reader/writers are available from Amazon for about $70 (as of September 2022). https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JTFZPFG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

I don't know if the cards can be purchased separately. Perhaps they are only sold in the Garmin FlightPlan Migrator Kit.


## Instructions ##

1. Create a new flight plan and save it as a KML file. For example, 'new_flight_plan.kml'
2. Decide on a prefix to name the waypoints of the new flight plan. For example, if you choose the prefix "A", the waypoints will be named: A01, A02, ..., A99.
3. Use python to run the KMLtoGarminFPL.py program like this:  "python ./KMLtoGarminFPL.py -i new_flight_plan.kml -n A"
4. The program will generate two files: "new_flight_plan_as_waypoints_A.kml" and "new_flight_plan_as_waypoints_A.fpl". The "new_flight_plan_as_waypoints_A.kml" file contains the new flight plan waypoints in a KML file. The "new_flight_plan_as_waypoints_A.fpl" file contains the new flight plan waypoints and the flight route in the Garmin FPL format.
5. Load the "new_flight_plan_as_waypoints_A.fpl" file onto a Garmin card using the Garmin FlightPlan Migrator software and the Garmin FlightPlan Migrator Kit's special card reader.
6. From the cockpit, remove the original card from the slot on the right side of the Garmin GNS unit.
7. Insert the card with the new FPL file into the slot on the right side of the Garmin GNS unit.
8. Power on the Garmin GNS unit.
8. Using the Garmin menu system, load the waypoints and flight plan. 
9. << IMPORTANT >> Turn off the Garmin GNS unit, remove the card with the FPL file, replace it with the original card, and then turn the Garmin GNS unit on
10. Confirm that the new waypoints and flight plan are loaded.


## Flight Plan KML files ##

During our project we defined flight plans as multi-part line shapefiles in QGIS and exported them as KML files. The resulting KML files defined the flight plan by a set of "longitude, latitude" locations, each defining the start/end point of each line segment. Specifically, the KML files have blocks like this:

```
<MultiGeometry><LineString><coordinates>-148.409488684457,70.1879369846318 -150.185878001433,71.3641064917923 -151.868207666983,71.6826939896295 -151.786142805248,71.7138328639197 -150.110904212891,71.395591937114 -150.025993171817,71.4296743112763 -151.700658574275,71.7449206097164 -151.610999271859,71.7760539944028 -149.93793727737,71.4646961861542 -149.843591676177,71.4996543291621 -151.526088230785,71.8074996278754 -151.438032336339,71.8388928343137 -149.75553578173,71.535544895473 -149.67376959403,71.5713682569899 -151.356266148638,71.869255081541 -151.258775694072,71.9034760808731 -149.585713699583,71.6051398244629 -149.503947511882,71.6368702451494 -151.164430092879,71.9376346478209 -151.082663905178,71.9697842051396 -149.415891617436,71.6725038002111 -149.340415136481,71.7021474148267 -150.997752864105,71.9999349054457 -150.903407262912,72.0310070735427 -149.258648948781,71.730758889851 -149.183172467826,71.7612957842083 -150.824785928584,72.0600901208561 -150.752454301003,72.0891276428685 -149.104551133499,71.7917833693959 -148.409538538044,70.1842836276263</coordinates></LineString></MultiGeometry>
```

Note that each  "longitude, latitude" pair is separated by a space and that the entire flight plan is defined in a single <coordinates></coordinates> block. The KMLtoGarminFPL.py Python code parses these coordinate pairs and simply rewrites them into a format that the the Garmin FlightPlan Migrator can understand.

Note: your input KML file has to have the same general format as the example code block above for the Python program to work. If your input KML file looks different, modify the Python code so that it parses your KML or reformat your KML. 

## Example ##

We include two example INPUT kml files and their corresponding OUTPUT fpl files. Input files:
1. Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01.kml
2. Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_02.kml

### Day 01 Example ###

The Day 01 Example input KML file is located in 
```./examples/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01.kml```

If you load this KML file into Google Earth or another software then you'll see the flight plan is a set of connected lines, starting and ending from Deadhorse Airport (PASC) in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.

![Day_01_map](figures/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01_original.jpg)

Now run the program, point to the Day 01 example flight plan KML file, and choose "A" as our waypoint prefix:

```
python ./KMLtoGarminFPL.py -i ./examples/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01.kml -n A
```

The output is as follows:

              GOOD LUCK! 
==============================================
```

You should be able to load the new FPL file in ```./examples/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01_as_waypoints_and_route_A.fpl``` into the Garmin FlightMigrator program and save it on the Garmin card.

The new KML file ``` ./examples/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01_as_waypoints_A.kml``` only includes the waypoints of the flight plan, with each waypoint named A01, A02, ... A99.

![Day_01_map as waypoints](figures/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_01_as_waypoints.jpg)

If you load the original KML flight LINES and the new KML flight WAYPOINTS you'll see the following:

### Day 02 Example ###

We include a second example day (input flight line KML and output waypoint KML and output FPL file) for your reference.  The code to run it is:

```python ./KMLtoGarminFPL.py -i ./examples/Example_flight_plan_lines_Day_02.kml -n B```

The output is:

```
KMLtoGarminFPL.py -i <input_kml_file> -o <output_file_noformat> -n <waypoint_prefix>
